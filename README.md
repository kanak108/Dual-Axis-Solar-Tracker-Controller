# Dual-Axis-Solar-Tracker-Controller
Accurately controls the position of Solar panels to align them to get maximum sunlight, thus producing the maximum energy. 

## Motivation

As the world increasingly turns to renewable energy sources to combat climate change and reduce dependency on fossil fuels, solar energy has become a focal point in the transition to a sustainable future. Solar trackers, which adjust the position of solar panels to follow the sun's trajectory, can significantly improve the efficiency of solar energy systems. By optimizing the angle of incidence between the solar panels and sunlight, trackers can enhance energy capture and, consequently, the overall output of solar power systems.

The significance of solar tracking technology is not limited to its environmental advantages. The renewable energy sector is experiencing a surge in demand for sophisticated tracking systems designed to optimize energy production and minimize expenses. Cutting-edge developments in solar tracking are swiftly being embraced by both large-scale solar farms and home-based solar setups, indicating a strong and expanding market eager for enhancements and deployment of such innovations.

## Project Description

This repository contains Simulink models and algorithms for designing and implementing a solar tracker controller. The goal is to create a simulation-based control system that manages the movement of at least one mechanical axis of a solar panel system to accurately track the sun's path across the sky. The project is based on the "Using the Worm and Gear Constraint Block - Solar Tracker" example from Simscape™ Multibody™.

### Key Components:

- **Azimuth Axis:** Allows horizontal rotation to align solar panels with the sun's east-west motion due to the Earth's rotation.
- **Elevation (Altitude) Axis:** Enables vertical movement to adjust panel tilt for varying sun elevation throughout the day and seasons.
- **Polar (or Roll) Axis:** Optional for additional adjustments, accommodating Earth's axial tilt or optimizing panel orientation based on location.

### Suggested Steps:

1. **Simulation and Modeling:**
   - Familiarize yourself with Simulink and Simscape Multibody using the provided solar tracker example.
   - Implement motor models using Simscape Electrical suitable for solar tracker applications.

2. **Control System Design:**
   - Design a control system for at least one axis using Simulink and Control System Toolbox.
   - Start with PID control and explore advanced strategies for better performance.

3. **Algorithm Development:**
   - Develop algorithms to calculate optimal axis positions based on solar position algorithms.
   - Ensure accurate tracking of the sun's path to maximize energy absorption.

4. **Validation and Analysis:**
   - Validate the entire system through simulation.
   - Analyze the efficiency of the solar panel system with and without the solar tracker using MATLAB tools.

5. **Advanced Work:**
   - Expand the model to include additional axes for more precise tracking.
   - Integrate machine learning for predictive sun trajectory and optimization.
   - Explore energy storage options and their integration with the solar tracker system.
